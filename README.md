# Not a lot files
At time of writing, I've had [my dotfiles][dotfiles] in one form or another for a couple of decades.
Not surprisingly, they're a lot.

Whilst setting up a new Linux laptop I began to wonder how many of these files I actually _need_.

- What if I tried using [Zed][zed], instead of my beloved [Neovim][neovim]?
- What if I tried using the default `bash` shell, instead of installing and configuring `zsh`?
- What if I used the default terminal, instead of [Wezterm][wezterm] or [Kitty][kitty]?
- What if, what if, what if..?

This is what if.
